Welcome to the RInChI Extended Toolkit documentation!
=====================================================

The aim of the RInChI project, in the same vein as InChI, is to create a unique data string to describe a reaction. 
Reaction InChIs, or RInChIs, are such data strings. They use the InChI software and from an rxn input file a RInChI can be created. 
The tools for doing this are below, and some helpful information is given in the help pages.

This is the documentation for the RInChI Extended Toolkit. For a demonstration of the 
active toolkit, please visit the active `RInChI site`_. Below is an index of the documentation for
the project. It includes documentation for the toolkit itself and the command line executables, including
help texts from the executables.
